Building a Chatbot using NLP
Introduction :

   A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users typically through text or voice interactions. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries or commands. They can be used for various purposes such as customer support, information retrieval,task automation,and entertainment.

NLP :

NLP is a way for computers to analyse,understy,and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilising NLP,developers can organise and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarisation, translation,named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis,speech recognition,and topic segmentation.

Data collection and preparation:

Data collection :
The chatbot collects data from various sources such as:
User interactions: conversations,queries,and feedback provided by users.
External APIs: information retrieved from external services or databases to enrich responses.
Logs and analytics: data collected from user sessions, including user demographics, preferences,and usage patterns.
Data collected from these sources are stored in a centralised database or repository for further processing.

Preprocessing:
Once the data is collected,it undergoes preprocessing to prepare it for analysis and training:
Text cleaning: Removing irrelevant characters,punctuation,and formatting inconsistencies.
Tokenization: breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens.
Stopword removal: eliminating common words that don't carry significant meaning.
Lemmatization or stemming: reducing words to their base or root from to improve consistency.

Data Preprocessing:


Tokenization: breaking down sentences into individual words or tokens
Lowercasing: converting all text to lowercase helps in standardising the text and reduces the vocabulary size.
Removing punctuation: removing punctuation marks from the text helps in focusing on the meaningful content.
Stopword removal: eliminating common words that don't carry significant.
Lemmatization or stemming: reducing words to their base or root from to improve consistency.
Stemming: stemming involves reducing words to their root from by removing suffixes. For example ,” running” becomes “run”

Feature engineering:

TF-IDF Approach:
  A problem with the bag of words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (eg.large score),but may not contain as much”informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.
Once approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized . This approach to scoring is called term frequency - Inverse document frequency,or TF-IDF for short,
Where:

Term frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.
     TF = (Number of times term t appears in a                         document ) / (Number of terms in the document)
Inverse document frequency: is a scoring of how are the word is across documents
IDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.

Input data ( preprocessed text): represents the preprocessed textual data obtained from user interactions.
Feature Extraction: process of extracting relevant features from the input data,such as word embeddings.
Model options: different categories of models considered for the chatbot, including rule based, machine learning (ml),and hybrid models.
Evaluation metrics: criteria used to evaluate each model option,such as accuracy, response coherence,and computational efficiency.
Model selection: decision - making process based on evaluation results to choose the most suitable model for the chatbot.
Chosen model: the selected model that best fits the requirements and constraints of the chatbot project.

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: plot a line graph showing the chatbot's accuracy overtime. You can calculate accuracy by comparing the chatbot's responses to a set of ground truth responses. The graph should show whether the accuracy is improving,plateauing, or declining.
Perplexity: use a bar chart to display the perplexity scores of the chatbot.
Perplexity measures how well the chatbot predicts a sequence of words.
Lower perplexity values indicate better performance. Plotting perplexity over time can help track the chatbot's language modelling capabilities.
Human evaluation: create a radar chart illustrating different aspects of human evaluation,such as fluency, relevance, helpfulness,and overall satisfaction. Each aspect can be rated on a scale from 1 to 5,with 5 being the highest. Plotting these ratings on a radar chart provides a comprehensive view of the chatbot's performance from a user's perspective.
Deployment :
1.Frontend Interface:
The frontend interface is the user- facing part of the web app where users interact with the chatbot.
It includes elements such as text inputs boxes, buttons,and conversation history displays to facilitate user interactions.
2.User Input Processing:
user inputs entered through the frontend interface are processed and sent to the backend server for further handling.
Input validation and Preprocessing may be performed to ensure data consistency and security.
3.Backend Server:
The backend server hosts the trained chatbot model and handling incoming user requests.
It serves as the intermediary between the frontend interface and the chatbot model, processing user inputs and generating responses.
4.Chatbot Model Integration:
The trained chatbot model is integrated into the backend server,allowing it to receive user inputs and generate responses 
The model may be deployed as a RESTful API endpoint or as a server- side module depending on the implementation.
5.Response Generation:
When a user input is received,the chatbot model processes the input and generates a response based on its trained parameters and algorithms.
The response is sent back to the frontend interface for display to the user.
6.Feedback Mechanism:
A feedback mechanism allows users to provide feedback on the chatbot's responses,which can be used to improve the model over time.
Feedback data may be collected and analysed to  identify patterns and areas for model refinement.
7.Error Handling and Logging:
Error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle exceptions and errors gracefully, providing users with information error messages when necessary 
Logging functionality records user interactions,errors,and system events for monitoring and debugging purposes
